Teammates === Jenna Lusk, Rose Elder, Jennifer Merry, Khushi Saini

---------------------------------------------Theme------------------------------------------------
Our theme is a midsize store similar to that of target with a rewards system for its customers.

----------------------------------------------Goal-------------------------------------------------
To begin with, Target is one of the largest discount retailers within the United States and as common consumers of the company, we seek further information regarding the discounts realm. College students are primarily drawn by discounts and coupons, hence, the goal of this application is to figure out the true advantages consumers and employees have through discounts, referrals, and coupons. There are numerous factors that play into markdowns and this dataset covers the ideology acquired to benefit both employees and consumers via the discounts and referrals. In addition, this application allows for the comprehension of rewards programs and the impact it has on consumer interaction with Target.
